# issue-explorer
This tool is a basic implementation of the "issue mapping" methodology as conceptualized in the book "Issue Mapping for an Aging Europe"
(https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789089647160/issue-mapping-for-an-ageing-europe)
It helps you create an editable table with "actors" and their "statments" from a set of pdf documents or websites which you can
export as a CSV file for further analysis.
The tool also provides simple sentiment analysis for the "statements" and a basic mapping function to get an overview of the 
greographic dimmension of your issue of choice.
